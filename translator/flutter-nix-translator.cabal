description:
  Creates a flutter-nix lock file in JSON necessary to build the Flutter app in
  Nix sandbox.

  Pubspec file is used to get the name and the version of the Flutter app.
  Pubspec lock file is used to calculate the URL of the Pub packages and
  prefetch them to calculate their hashes.

  A file in JSON format is used to calculate the URLs of the Flutter SDK
  dependencies. This file is considered an implementation detail and passed to
  the translator with an environment variable.
